# Freshflow-interview

This repository contains two jupyter notebooks. 
One is for the data analysis and visualization part. 
The other notebook is for the training part. 
I have used the Facebook prophet model for the forecasting problem and making the forecast of orders and sales from 10th February 2022 to 24th February 2022 for all the item names which are present in the dataset. 
Due to shortage of time I wasn't able to produce the actual python file for the train part and I have produced the jupyter notebook working on the colab notebook.
